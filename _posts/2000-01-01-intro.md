Another dreamchild of Pawan Kumar, director of the movie [LUCIA](http://www.hometalkies.com/lucia/watch/), is coming up! He has named it C10H14N2, the chemical formula of Nicotine. It's an Action Drama Thriller. As the title suggests the film is about that theme.
This is an attempt to fund the movie by pre-ordering it. Why do we have to pre-order it?! Why can't he find a producer for the movie? Well, see the 'why' page.
