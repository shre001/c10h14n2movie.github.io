#**It all started with Lucia!**

Pawan Kumar explains how he came up with the idea called Lucia [here](http://www.hometalkies.com/lucia/2011/12/the-idea-called-lucia/). So when he was ready with the script, no producer dared to make it a movie because it had no 'masala' in it! 

When there was no hope, Pawan had to turn towards the audience. When he posted the idea of lucia on facebook, many people supported and few opposed. But an idea never dies, it's immortal!

Then began the crowd-funding strategy for [Project-Lucia](http://pawantheactor.com/?page_id=1653). Pawan was able to raise 3,00,000 INR in just 2 days!

After an year, Lucia came out on big screens winning Audience choice best film in LIFF. It has been to many film festivals and made all Kannadigas proud! It was the only movie to get a 'House Full' board on LIFF.

[Here](http://www.hometalkies.com/lucia/reviews/) is a list of notable reviews the movie has got so far.
