#**It all started with Lucia!**

Pawan Kumar explains how he came up with the idea called Lucia [here](http://www.hometalkies.com/lucia/2011/12/the-idea-called-lucia/). So when he was ready with the script, no producer dared to make it a movie because it had no 'masala' in it! 

When there was no hope, Pawan had to turn towards the audience. When he posted the idea of lucia on facebook, many people supported and few opposed as the idea was quite novel for Kannada. But an idea never dies, it's immortal!

Then began the crowd-funding strategy for [Project-Lucia](http://pawantheactor.com/?page_id=1653). Pawan was able to raise 3,00,000 INR in just 2 days! That's huge for a Kannada movie.

After an year, Lucia came out on big screens winning Audience choice best film in LIFF. It has been to many film festivals and made all Kannadigas proud! It was the only movie to get a 'House Full' board on LIFF.

[Here](http://www.hometalkies.com/lucia/reviews/) is a list of notable reviews the movie has got so far.

##**How the crowd-funding works?**

###Hear it in Pawan's words!

"The movie will be produced by YOU – the audience. For years you have complained that you don’t like what is being produced in the Kannada industry and similarly I don’t like what I am forced to make as a director. So let’s come together and solve each others problems!

The idea is simple. I am selling 2000 tickets for the movie Lucia; I will start making the movie after all the tickets are sold. Crazy, right! But it’s true. By selling 2000 tickets I intend to raise 100,000 US dollars (50 lakh Indian rupees approximately) and this is the funding that will go into making this movie.

If you don’t have faith in this, and if you don’t trust me and my intentions, you could skip reading the rest. No hard feelings, I know this is not easy.

If you want to know about my credentials before you buy your ticket, please browse through the site, you will get to know everything you want to know about me and my work. You could also see my debut feature film – [Lifeu Ishtene](http://muvi.es/w714/312452) and then decide whether you want to buy a ticket or not."
