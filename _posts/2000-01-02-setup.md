#Why raise fund?

#**Why crowd-funding? Why not a producer?**

>>>>>>> origin/master

1. This is an expensive film.

2. Such an investment has no returns in the Kannada market.

3. Satellite channels may not be interested in buying it at all.

4. The film has no reason to have popular genre songs.

5. This script will not interest a star or his audience.


Should such a film be made in Kannada? If yes, who will come forward to invest with such financial risks? Are there any means other than bringing the audience together to pre order and hence use the funds to make the film?
